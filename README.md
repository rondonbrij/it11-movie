# IT11-Final Project: Movie Search Web Application x TMDb

<strong>Movie Search Web Application</strong>

This web application allows users to search for movies, view upcoming movies, and explore detailed information about a specific movie. It also provides a list of similar movies based on the currently viewed movie.

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive and responsive movie searcher web application using the The Movie Database (TMDb) API. The application aims to showcase upcoming movies, allow users to search for specific movies, and provide comprehensive details about each movie. This web application was developed by [Ronillynuel James Agum](https://www.facebook.com/ronxxxron) for the IT11 Final Project.
